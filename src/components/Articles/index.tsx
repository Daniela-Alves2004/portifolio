                    <h2>Updating a Systematic Literature Review on Knowledge Management<br></br>Diagnostics in Software Development Organizations
                    </h2>

                    <p>Context: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, organizations face the constant challenge to work with the knowledge generated. Knowledge<br></br> 
                        Management (KM) can be applied to efficiently manage the knowledge in software development organizations and ensure the product quality. However,<br></br>
                        although there are several KM approaches, carrying out a KM diagnosis in the organization can identify which knowledge activities present the best cost-benefit for the organization. A<br></br> 
                        Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was published in 2018, presenting evidence on KM diagnosis in software development organizations. From an assessment of this SLR<br></br> 
                        and the current state of this research topic, we noticed that the 2018 SLR needed maintenance.
                       <br></br> Objective: This study aims to update and extend the results produced in this previous SLR.
                       <br></br>Method: We conducted the 2018 SLR update, considering a new database, backward and forward snowballing,
                        and more analyses of the extracted data.
                        <br></br> Results:....
