      titleArticle: "Updating a Systematic Literature Review on Knowledge Management Diagnostics in Software Development Organizations",
      abstract: `Context: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, organizations face the constant challenge to work with the generated knowledge. 
      Knowledge Management (KM) can be applied to efficiently manage the knowledge in software development organizations and ensure the product quality. However, although there are several KM approaches, carrying out a KM diagnosis in the organizations can identify which knowledge activities present the best cost-benefit for the organization. 
      There are several KM approaches suggested in the literature. But it is quite relevant to carry out a KM diagnosis in the organizations to clearly identify which knowledge activities can present the best cost-benefit aspect within the organizations. 
      A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was published in 2018, presenting evidence on KM diagnosis in software development organizations. 
      From an assessment of this SLR and the current state of this research topic, we noticed that the 2018 SLR needed maintenance with an update.
      Objective: This study aims to update and extend the results produced in this previous SLR. 
      Method: We conducted the 2018 SLR update, considering a new database, backward and forward snowballing, and more analyses of the extracted data.
      Results: From the SLR update, 16 new studies on KM diagnoses in Software Engineering context were identified. 
      Conclusion: In Software Engineering, consolidated models continue lacking for applying KM diagnostics. Moreover, computational approaches to provide automated support in the diagnosis application and analysis are not quite well explored.`,

        abstract: `This paper contains a report on the actions promoted by the
                        Meninas Digitais UTFPR-CP extension project, which is a partner project
                        of the Meninas Digitais Program, from SBC. The project, created within the
                        Federal Technological University of Parana, Corn  ́ elio Proc  ́ opio Campus, aims  ́
                        to increase the participation of girls and women in computing and STEM,
                        encouraging and helping elementary and high school girls from public schools
                        in the cities of Cornelio Proc  ́ opio and the surrounding area, in the interior  ́
                        of Parana, to conquer their space in these areas. To this end, the project  ́
                        promotes actions such as programming workshops, mentoring and discussion
                        groups, including in these actions the resolution of challenges of the Sustainable
                        Development Goals (SDGs).`,
