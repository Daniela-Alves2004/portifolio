                    <p>
                        I volunteer as a front-end developer at Pipoca √Ågil,
                        where I develop solutions using technologies such as React.js,
                        TypeScript, SCSS, and Vite. At Yadax,
                        I gained experience in Oracle database administration,
                        performing maintenance tasks.
                        During my Software Engineering degree,
                        I not only learned technical concepts but also
                        participated in extension projects like Meninas Digitais,
                        where I currently serve as a coordinator, and have previously
                        been a mentor and leader of the marketing sector.
                        These experiences helped me develop interpersonal
                        skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership.
                        Additionally, I participated in a scientific initiation,
                        which improved my writing skills and provided me with a solid
                        foundation in conducting scientific research.
