                    <p>
                        I volunteer as a <span>front-end developer</span> at Pipoca √Ågil,
                        where I develop solutions using technologies such as React.js,
                        TypeScript, SCSS,and Vite. At Yadax,
                        I gained experience in Oracle database  administration,
                        performing maintenance tasks.
                        <br /> <br />
                        During my <span>Software Engineering</span> degree,
                        I not only learned technical concepts but also
                        participated in extension projects like Meninas  Digitais,
                        where I currently <span>serve as a coordinator</span>, and have previously
                        been a mentor and <span>leader</span> of the <span>marketing </span>sector.
                        These experiences helped me develop interpersonal
                        skills such as <span>communication</span>, <span>teamwork</span>, and <span>leadership</span>.
                        Additionally, I participated in a <span>cientific initiation</span>,
                        which improved my writing skills and provided me with a solid
                        foundation in conducting scientific research.
